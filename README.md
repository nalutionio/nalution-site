# NalutionSolution.com – Temporary Landing Page

## Overview
This repository contains the **current public landing page** for **NalutionSolution.com**.

At this stage, the website’s primary purpose is **not** to serve as a full product platform, but to act as a **placeholder, brand presence, and point of contact** while the core Nalution platform — **NalutionLink** — is being developed and prepared for a **private launch**.

## Purpose of This Landing Page

- Clearly communicate **who we are** and **what we’re building**
- Provide a **contact point** for early interest and inquiries

- Maintain an online presence while NalutionLink is developed privately

This site is intentionally lightweight and informational.
